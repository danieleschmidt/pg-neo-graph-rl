# ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub Actions Setup Required

## Issue Resolution
The GitHub App used for this commit does not have `workflows` permission, which prevented the automatic creation of the GitHub Actions workflow file.

## Manual Setup Required

### üìÅ Workflow File Location
The production deployment workflow has been created at:
```
docs/workflows/production-deployment.yml
```

### üîß Setup Instructions

#### 1. Copy Workflow File
```bash
# Create the .github/workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows

# Copy the workflow file to the correct location
cp docs/workflows/production-deployment.yml .github/workflows/production-deployment.yml

# Commit the workflow file
git add .github/workflows/production-deployment.yml
git commit -m "Add production deployment workflow"
git push
```

#### 2. Configure Repository Secrets
In your GitHub repository settings, add these secrets:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

#### 3. Setup AWS Resources
```bash
# Create S3 bucket for Terraform state
aws s3 mb s3://pg-neo-graph-rl-terraform-state

# Create DynamoDB table for state locking
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name terraform-state-lock \
    --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=5,WriteCapacityUnits=5
```

## üìö Complete Setup Guide
For detailed instructions, see: `docs/workflows/SETUP_GITHUB_ACTIONS.md`

## ‚úÖ What's Already Complete
- ‚úÖ Complete production deployment infrastructure (Terraform)
- ‚úÖ Kubernetes manifests with auto-scaling
- ‚úÖ Docker configurations (CPU + GPU)
- ‚úÖ Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
- ‚úÖ All deployment scripts and automation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

## üöÄ After Setup
Once the workflow is in place, you'll have:
- Automated testing on every PR
- Automatic deployment to production on main branch pushes
- Container builds with security scanning
- Infrastructure deployment with Terraform
- Kubernetes rolling deployments
- Automated smoke tests and health checks

The system is **production-ready** and this is just a minor setup step to enable the full CI/CD pipeline.
