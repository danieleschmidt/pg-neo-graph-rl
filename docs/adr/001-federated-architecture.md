# ADR-001: Federated Learning Architecture for Distributed Graph RL

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Deciders:** Research Team, Engineering Lead, Architecture Team  
**Technical Story:** Core system architecture for federated graph reinforcement learning  

## Context

The PG-Neo-Graph-RL system needs to support distributed reinforcement learning across thousands of agents in city-scale infrastructure (traffic networks, power grids, swarm systems). Key challenges include:

- **Privacy Requirements:** Infrastructure operators cannot share raw operational data
- **Scale Constraints:** Centralized learning doesn't scale to 10,000+ agents
- **Communication Limits:** Bandwidth constraints in distributed deployments
- **Fault Tolerance:** System must continue operating with node failures
- **Real-time Performance:** Decision latency must be <100ms for critical systems

Existing centralized RL approaches fail to meet these requirements, while naive distributed approaches suffer from poor convergence and coordination.

## Decision

We will implement a **gossip-based federated learning architecture** with the following key components:

1. **Decentralized Parameter Aggregation:** Use gossip protocols instead of centralized parameter servers
2. **Local Learning:** Each agent trains on local subgraphs and shares only gradient updates
3. **Dynamic Topology:** Support for time-varying communication graphs
4. **Privacy-First Design:** Implement differential privacy and secure aggregation
5. **Hierarchical Structure:** Support both flat and hierarchical federated topologies

This architecture enables privacy-preserving, scalable distributed learning while maintaining convergence guarantees.

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Centralized Parameter Server
- **Description:** Traditional centralized approach with a parameter server coordinating all agents
- **Pros:** 
  - Simple to implement and debug
  - Well-established convergence theory
  - Easy to monitor and control
- **Cons:**
  - Single point of failure
  - Bandwidth bottleneck at parameter server
  - Privacy concerns with centralized data aggregation
  - Poor scalability beyond 100 agents
- **Cost/Effort:** Low

### Option 2: Gossip-Based Federated Learning (Chosen)
- **Description:** Decentralized approach where agents share parameters with random neighbors
- **Pros:** 
  - No single point of failure
  - Better privacy preservation
  - Scalable to thousands of agents
  - Fault tolerant to node failures
  - Reduced communication overhead
- **Cons:**
  - More complex implementation
  - Slower convergence than centralized
  - Challenging to debug and monitor
  - Requires careful design for convergence guarantees
- **Cost/Effort:** Medium

### Option 3: Blockchain-Based Consensus
- **Description:** Use blockchain consensus mechanisms for parameter updates
- **Pros:** 
  - Strong consistency guarantees
  - Built-in fault tolerance
  - Transparent and auditable
- **Cons:**
  - Extremely high computational overhead
  - Poor scalability and speed
  - Energy intensive
  - Overkill for RL parameter sharing
- **Cost/Effort:** High

### Option 4: Ring-Based AllReduce
- **Description:** Arrange agents in a ring topology for parameter synchronization
- **Pros:** 
  - Efficient bandwidth utilization
  - Predictable communication patterns
  - Good convergence properties
- **Cons:**
  - Vulnerable to single node failures
  - Static topology limitations
  - Difficulty with dynamic agent participation
- **Cost/Effort:** Medium

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Scalability:** System can support 10,000+ agents without architectural changes
- **Privacy:** Agents never share raw data, only gradient updates with noise
- **Fault Tolerance:** System continues operating even with 30% node failures
- **Flexibility:** Supports various graph topologies and communication patterns
- **Real-world Viability:** Architecture matches constraints of actual infrastructure deployments

### Negative Consequences
- **Complexity:** Significantly more complex than centralized approaches
- **Convergence Speed:** 2-3x slower convergence compared to centralized learning
- **Debugging Difficulty:** Distributed issues are harder to diagnose and fix
- **Coordination Overhead:** Need sophisticated protocols for agent coordination
- **Testing Challenges:** Difficult to create realistic test environments

### Neutral Consequences
- **Communication Patterns:** Different but not necessarily worse than centralized
- **Resource Usage:** Shifts from centralized server to distributed computation
- **Monitoring Needs:** Requires distributed monitoring instead of centralized

## Implementation

### Action Items

- **Phase 3:** Q3 2025 - Hierarchical topologies and production optimizations

### Success Criteria
- Support 1,000+ agents with <5% performance degradation
- Achieve convergence within 2x of centralized baseline
- Maintain privacy budget ε ≤ 1.0 with acceptable utility
- System continues operating with up to 30% node failures
- Communication overhead <10% of total computation time

### Rollback Plan
- Implement centralized fallback mode for critical deployments
- Maintain compatibility with centralized parameter server interface
- Create migration tools for switching between architectures
- Estimated rollback effort: 2-3 weeks

## Compliance and Governance

### Security Implications
- **Risks:** Potential gradient inversion attacks, Byzantine agents
- **Mitigations:** Differential privacy, secure aggregation, Byzantine fault tolerance
- **Reviews:** Security team approval required for privacy mechanisms

### Privacy Implications
- **Data Protection:** Raw infrastructure data never leaves local agents
- **Privacy Budget:** Formal differential privacy guarantees with ε ≤ 1.0
- **Compliance:** Meets GDPR requirements for infrastructure data protection

### Legal and Licensing
- **Technologies:** All core algorithms use permissive licenses (MIT, Apache 2.0)
- **Patents:** No known patent conflicts with gossip protocols
- **Constraints:** Some jurisdictions may have restrictions on cryptographic exports

## Monitoring and Validation

### Metrics to Track
- **Performance:** Convergence rate, final policy quality, communication overhead
- **Scalability:** Agent count vs. performance degradation
- **Reliability:** System uptime, fault recovery time, message delivery rates
- **Privacy:** Privacy budget consumption, gradient leakage measures

### Validation Methods
- **Simulation:** Large-scale simulations with 1,000+ agents
- **Benchmarking:** Comparison against centralized baselines
- **Real-world Testing:** Pilot deployments in controlled environments
- **Security Audits:** Third-party privacy and security assessments

### Review Schedule
- **Quarterly:** Performance and scalability review
