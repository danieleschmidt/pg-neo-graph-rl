# 0003. Graph Neural Network Architecture

Date: 2025-08-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

PG-Neo-Graph-RL operates on dynamic graph structures representing infrastructure networks (traffic, power grids, swarms). The system requires neural network architectures that can:

1. **Handle Dynamic Topologies**: Graphs that change over time (edges appear/disappear)
2. **Scale to Large Graphs**: Networks with 1000+ nodes and 10000+ edges
3. **Capture Temporal Dependencies**: Time-series behavior in node and edge features
4. **Support Distributed Learning**: Gradients must be computable and aggregatable
5. **Enable Real-time Inference**: Fast forward passes for control applications

Architecture alternatives considered:
- **Standard GCN**: Simple but limited expressiveness, no temporal modeling
- **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)**: Attention mechanism but computationally expensive
- **GraphSAINT**: Scalable sampling but loses global structure information
- **Temporal Graph Networks**: Good temporal modeling but complex implementation
- **Graph Transformers**: Powerful but quadratic complexity in graph size

## Decision

We will use a **Temporal Graph Attention** architecture as the core neural network component, implemented in JAX/Flax.

**Key architectural components:**

1. **Temporal Encoding Layer**:
   ```python
   def time_encoding(timestamps, hidden_dim):
       frequencies = learnable_parameter(shape=(hidden_dim // 2,))
       return concat([sin(timestamps * frequencies), cos(timestamps * frequencies)])
   ```

2. **Multi-Head Graph Attention**:
   ```python
   def graph_attention(nodes, edges, edge_index, num_heads=8):
       # Compute attention scores between connected nodes
       attention_scores = compute_attention(nodes, edges, num_heads)
       # Aggregate neighbor information
       messages = aggregate_messages(attention_scores, nodes, edge_index)
       return messages
   ```

3. **Hierarchical Message Passing**:
   - Local attention within k-hop neighborhoods
   - Global attention for long-range dependencies
   - Efficient sparse attention patterns

4. **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**:
   - Skip connections for gradient flow
   - Layer normalization for training stability

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Expressiveness**: Attention mechanism captures complex node interactions
- **Scalability**: Sparse attention patterns reduce computational complexity
- **Temporal Modeling**: Explicit time encoding handles dynamic graphs
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to different graph sizes and topologies
- **Performance**: JAX implementation enables efficient compilation and execution
- **Interpretability**: Attention weights provide insights into decision-making

### Negative Consequences

- **Computational Complexity**: O(|E| * d * h) where |E| is edges, d is hidden dim, h is heads
- **Memory Requirements**: Attention matrices can be large for dense graphs
- **Implementation Complexity**: More complex than simple GCN variants
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Many parameters to tune (heads, layers, dimensions)
- **Training Stability**: Attention can be unstable without proper initialization

### Risks

- **Scalability Limits**: Attention may not scale to very large graphs (100k+ nodes)
  - *Mitigation*: Graph sampling, hierarchical attention, sparse attention patterns
- **Overfitting**: Complex architecture may overfit on small datasets
  - *Mitigation*: Dropout, regularization, data augmentation
- **Training Difficulty**: Gradient vanishing/exploding in deep networks
  - *Mitigation*: Residual connections, gradient clipping, careful initialization

### Implementation Specifications

**Network Architecture**:
```python
class TemporalGraphAttentionNetwork(nn.Module):
    hidden_dim: int = 128
    num_heads: int = 8
    num_layers: int = 3
    dropout_rate: float = 0.1
    
    def __call__(self, nodes, edges, edge_index, timestamps):
        # Time encoding
        time_embed = self.time_encoding(timestamps)
        x = concat([nodes, time_embed], axis=-1)
        
        # Graph attention layers
        for layer in range(self.num_layers):
            x_residual = x
            x = self.graph_attention_layer(x, edges, edge_index)
            x = self.layer_norm(x + x_residual)  # Residual connection
            x = dropout(x, self.dropout_rate)
        
        return x
```

**Optimization Techniques**:
- **Gradient Checkpointing**: Save memory for very deep networks
- **Mixed Precision**: Use float16 for forward pass, float32 for gradients
- **Graph Sampling**: Sample subgraphs for large-scale training
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient batching of multiple graphs

**Performance Targets**:
- **Inference Latency**: <10ms for graphs with 1000 nodes
- **Memory Usage**: <2GB GPU memory for training
- **Scalability**: Handle graphs up to 10k nodes without sampling
