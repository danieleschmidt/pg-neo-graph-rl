# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the PG-Neo-Graph-RL project.

## About ADRs

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

## ADR Format

We use the following format for ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-001: [Decision Title]

**Status:** [Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Deciders:** [List of people involved]
**Technical Story:** [Link to relevant issue/story]

## Context

What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?

## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?

## Consequences

### Positive
- What becomes easier or better?

### Negative
- What becomes more difficult or worse?

### Neutral
- Other implications

## Implementation

- How will this decision be implemented?
- What are the key milestones?

## References

- Links to relevant documentation
- Related ADRs
- External resources
```

## Current ADRs

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------| ---- |
| [ADR-001](001-federated-architecture.md) | Federated Learning Architecture | Accepted | 2025-01-15 |
| [ADR-002](002-jax-backend.md) | JAX as Primary Backend | Accepted | 2025-01-16 |
| [ADR-003](003-graph-neural-networks.md) | Graph Neural Network Design | Accepted | 2025-01-18 |
| [ADR-004](004-privacy-mechanisms.md) | Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms | Proposed | 2025-01-20 |
| [ADR-005](005-communication-protocol.md) | Inter-Agent Communication | Proposed | 2025-01-22 |

## ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed:** The ADR is drafted and under discussion
2. **Accepted:** The decision has been approved and will be implemented
3. **Deprecated:** The decision is no longer recommended but may still be in use
4. **Superseded:** The decision has been replaced by a newer ADR

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template from `template.md`
2. Name the file with the next sequential number: `00X-descriptive-title.md`
3. Fill in all sections thoroughly
4. Submit as a pull request for review
5. Update this README with the new ADR entry

## Review Process

- All ADRs must be reviewed by at least 2 senior team members
- Technical leads must approve architectural decisions
- Community input is encouraged for major decisions
- ADRs should be living documents, updated as needed

## Decision Criteria

When making architectural decisions, consider:

- **Performance:** Impact on system performance and scalability
- **Maintainability:** Long-term code maintenance and evolution
- **Security:** Security implications and risk assessment
- **Privacy:** Data protection and privacy compliance
- **Interoperability:** Integration with existing systems
- **Community:** Adoption potential and community support
- **Resources:** Development time and infrastructure costs
