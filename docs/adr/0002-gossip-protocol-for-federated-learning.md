# 0002. Gossip Protocol for Federated Learning

Date: 2025-08-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Federated learning in PG-Neo-Graph-RL requires efficient communication between distributed agents. The system must handle:

1. **Scalability**: Support 100-1000+ agents without communication bottlenecks
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Continue operating when agents fail or disconnect
3. **Privacy**: Minimize information leakage during parameter sharing
4. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Reduce communication overhead in resource-constrained environments
5. **Convergence**: Maintain learning quality despite decentralized aggregation

Communication pattern alternatives considered:
- **Centralized (Parameter Server)**: Simple but single point of failure, privacy concerns
- **All-to-All**: Perfect information but O(nÂ²) communication complexity
- **Ring Topology**: Predictable but vulnerable to single node failures
- **Hierarchical**: Efficient but requires coordination infrastructure
- **Gossip Protocol**: Decentralized, fault-tolerant, scalable

## Decision

We will implement gossip-based parameter aggregation as the primary communication protocol for federated learning.

**Key features:**
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Agents exchange parameters with random neighbors
- **Mixing Matrix**: Weighted averaging based on trust scores and connectivity
- **Adaptive Topology**: Dynamic neighbor selection based on network conditions
- **Privacy Preservation**: Only partial parameter sharing, differential privacy compatible

**Implementation approach:**
```python
def gossip_round(agent_id, parameters, mixing_weights):
    neighbors = sample_neighbors(agent_id, k=3)
    for neighbor in neighbors:
        neighbor_params = get_neighbor_parameters(neighbor)
        weight = mixing_weights[agent_id, neighbor]
        parameters = weight * parameters + (1-weight) * neighbor_params
    return parameters
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Scalability**: O(k) communication per agent where k << n (number of agents)
- **Fault Tolerance**: No single point of failure, graceful degradation
- **Privacy**: Only pairwise parameter sharing, supports differential privacy
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable topology based on network conditions
- **Convergence**: Proven theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions
- **Implementation Simplicity**: Straightforward to implement and debug

### Negative Consequences

- **Convergence Speed**: Slower than centralized approaches, especially early in training
- **Load Balancing**: Uneven parameter sharing may create temporary imbalances
- **Coordination Overhead**: Requires neighbor discovery and failure detection
- **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: Mixing weights and neighbor selection affect performance
- **Theoretical Complexity**: Analysis requires understanding of random graph theory

### Risks

- **Slow Convergence**: May not converge quickly enough for real-time applications
  - *Mitigation*: Hybrid approach with periodic centralized coordination
- **Network Partitions**: Graph disconnection prevents global convergence
  - *Mitigation*: Connectivity monitoring and automatic bridging
- **Malicious Agents**: Byzantine agents can poison the aggregation process
  - *Mitigation*: Byzantine-robust aggregation methods, reputation systems

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 1: Basic Gossip**
- Simple random neighbor selection
- Uniform mixing weights
- Synchronous rounds

**Phase 2: Adaptive Gossip**
- Dynamic neighbor selection based on performance
- Trust-based mixing weights
- Asynchronous communication

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Byzantine fault tolerance
- Differential privacy integration
- Topology optimization

### Evaluation Metrics

- **Convergence Rate**: Rounds to reach target performance
- **Communication Volume**: Total bytes exchanged per round
- **Fault Tolerance**: Performance degradation under node failures
- **Privacy Leakage**: Information theoretic measures
- **Scalability**: Performance vs. number of agents
