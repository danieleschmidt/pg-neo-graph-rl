## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT Open a Public Issue

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

### 2. Send a Private Report

Send a detailed report to our security team at: **security@terragon.ai**

Include the following information:
- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish with this vulnerability?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Python version, JAX version, operating system
- **Proof of Concept**: Code snippet or exploit demonstration (if applicable)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours with assessment and timeline
- **Resolution**: Target resolution within 90 days for critical issues

## Security Considerations

### AI/ML Security Risks

This project involves machine learning and distributed systems. Be aware of:

**Model Security:**
- Adversarial attacks on trained models
- Model inversion and membership inference attacks
- Backdoor attacks through training data

**Federated Learning Security:**
- Byzantine attacks in distributed training
- Privacy leakage through gradient analysis
- Communication interception and tampering

**Data Privacy:**
- Sensitive data exposure in logs or checkpoints
- Inference attacks on training data
- Cross-agent information leakage

### Best Practices for Users

**Environment Security:**
```bash
# Use virtual environments
python -m venv secure_env
source secure_env/bin/activate

# Verify package integrity
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt

# Keep dependencies updated
pip-audit
```

**Model Security:**
```python
# Sanitize inputs
def validate_graph_input(graph_data):
    # Implement input validation
    pass

# Secure model checkpointing
def save_model_securely(model, path):
    # Use encrypted storage for sensitive models
    pass
```

**Communication Security:**
```python
# Use TLS for federated communication
config = FederatedConfig(
    use_tls=True,
    verify_certificates=True,
    encryption_key=os.environ["FED_ENCRYPTION_KEY"]
)
```

## Vulnerability Categories

## Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as patches to supported versions
- Announced via GitHub Security Advisories
- Documented in CHANGELOG.md with `[SECURITY]` prefix

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate security researchers who:
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure
- Provide clear reproduction steps
- Suggest potential mitigations

**Recognition:**
- Security contributors will be acknowledged (with permission)
- Critical findings may be eligible for recognition rewards
- We maintain a security contributors hall of fame

## Security Resources

### External Security Tools
