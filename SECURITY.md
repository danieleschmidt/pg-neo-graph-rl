- Your contact information

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Assessment**: Security team will assess the vulnerability within 5 business days
3. **Fix Development**: We'll work on a fix and coordinate disclosure timeline
4. **Release**: Security patch will be released with appropriate notifications
5. **Credit**: We'll credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Considerations

### Federated Learning Security

When using pg-neo-graph-rl in federated settings, consider these security aspects:

#### Data Privacy
- **Local Data**: Keep sensitive data local to federated agents
- **Gradient Privacy**: Use differential privacy mechanisms when needed
- **Secure Aggregation**: Implement secure multi-party computation for gradient aggregation

#### Communication Security
- **Encryption**: Use TLS/SSL for all federated communication
- **Authentication**: Implement proper agent authentication
- **Message Integrity**: Verify message integrity and authenticity

#### Model Security
- **Model Poisoning**: Validate and sanitize received model updates
- **Backdoor Attacks**: Monitor for suspicious model behavior
- **Byzantine Robustness**: Use robust aggregation methods when appropriate

### Deployment Security

#### Environment Security
```python
# Example: Secure environment configuration
from pg_neo_graph_rl.security import SecureFederatedEnv

env = SecureFederatedEnv(
    encryption_enabled=True,
    certificate_path="/path/to/certificates",
    auth_required=True,
    audit_logging=True
)
```

#### Input Validation
- Validate all graph inputs for malicious content
- Sanitize environment configurations
- Check model parameter bounds

#### Resource Protection
- Implement proper resource limits
- Monitor for denial-of-service attacks
- Use containerization for isolation

### Privacy Protection

#### Differential Privacy
```python
from pg_neo_graph_rl.privacy import DifferentiallyPrivateFedRL

# Configure privacy parameters
privacy_config = {
    "epsilon": 1.0,      # Privacy budget
    "delta": 1e-5,       # Privacy parameter
    "noise_multiplier": 1.1,
    "clipping_threshold": 1.0
}

fed_rl = DifferentiallyPrivateFedRL(**privacy_config)
```

#### Data Minimization
- Only collect necessary data
- Implement data retention policies
- Provide data deletion capabilities

### Monitoring and Auditing

#### Security Monitoring
- Log all federated communications
- Monitor for anomalous agent behavior
- Track model performance degradation

#### Audit Trail
- Maintain comprehensive audit logs
- Record all security-relevant events
- Enable forensic analysis capabilities

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   def validate_graph_input(graph_data):
       """Validate graph input for security issues."""
       if graph_data.num_nodes > MAX_NODES:
           raise SecurityError("Graph too large")
       
       if not is_valid_adjacency_matrix(graph_data.adjacency):
           raise SecurityError("Invalid adjacency matrix")
   ```

2. **Secure Defaults**
   - Enable security features by default
   - Use secure communication protocols
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Code Review**
   - Review all security-sensitive code
   - Use automated security scanning tools
   - Follow secure coding guidelines

### For Users

1. **Network Security**
   - Use VPNs for federated communication
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Monitor network traffic

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Use strong authentication mechanisms
   - Regularly rotate credentials

3. **Environment Hardening**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use minimal container images
   - Apply security patches promptly

## Known Security Considerations

### JAX Security
- JAX JIT compilation can expose timing information
- Be cautious with `jax.random` in secure contexts
- Consider deterministic execution for sensitive applications

### Graph Neural Networks
- Graph structure can leak information
- Node features may contain sensitive data
- Message passing can propagate malicious content

### Federated Learning
- Gradient updates may leak training data information
- Model updates can be used for inference attacks
- Communication patterns may reveal sensitive information

## Security Tools and Resources

### Recommended Tools
- **Static Analysis**: bandit, semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning**: safety, pip-audit
- **Container Security**: trivy, clair
- **Network Security**: wireshark, nmap

### Security Libraries
- **Cryptography**: cryptography, PyNaCl
- **Differential Privacy**: opacus, tensorflow-privacy
- **Secure Communication**: requests with certificates
