# Project Charter: PG-Neo-Graph-RL

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: PG-Neo-Graph-RL (Federated Graph-Neural Reinforcement Learning)

**Project Vision**: To create the leading open-source framework for distributed, privacy-preserving reinforcement learning on dynamic graph structures, enabling scalable control of city-scale infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

Current reinforcement learning approaches for distributed control systems face critical limitations:

1. **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Centralized training doesn't scale to city-scale networks (1000+ agents)
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Sensitive infrastructure data cannot be shared centrally
3. **Dynamic Topology**: Existing methods struggle with time-varying graph structures
4. **Communication Constraints**: Limited bandwidth between distributed agents
5. **Real-time Requirements**: Infrastructure control demands sub-second response times

## Solution Approach

PG-Neo-Graph-RL addresses these challenges through:

- **Federated Learning**: Decentralized training preserves data privacy
- **Dynamic Graph Neural Networks**: Handle time-varying topologies efficiently  
- **Gossip Communication**: Reduces communication overhead by 10-100x
- **JAX Acceleration**: Enables real-time performance at scale
- **Safety Guarantees**: Built-in constraints for critical infrastructure

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Performance**: 30%+ improvement over baseline methods in benchmark scenarios
2. **Scalability**: Handle 1000+ agents with <1s communication latency
3. **Privacy**: Provable differential privacy guarantees (ε ≤ 1.0)
4. **Adoption**: 100+ GitHub stars, 10+ contributors within 6 months

### Secondary Success Metrics  
1. **Documentation**: 90%+ API coverage, comprehensive tutorials
2. **Testing**: 85%+ code coverage, automated CI/CD
3. **Community**: Active Slack/Discord, regular contributor meetings
4. **Publications**: Accept at top-tier ML conference (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)
