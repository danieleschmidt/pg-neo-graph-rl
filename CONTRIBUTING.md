## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pg-neo-graph-rl.git
   cd pg-neo-graph-rl
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

5. **Run tests to verify setup**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run quality checks**
   ```bash
   # Format code
   black src/ tests/
   isort src/ tests/
   
   # Run linting
   flake8 src/ tests/
   mypy src/
   
   # Run tests
   pytest
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `docs:` documentation changes
- `style:` formatting changes
- `refactor:` code refactoring
- `test:` adding or updating tests
- `chore:` maintenance tasks

## Code Style

- **Python Style**: We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- **Import Sorting**: We use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import organization
- **Line Length**: 88 characters maximum
- **Type Hints**: Required for all public functions and methods
- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all public APIs

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_example.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=pg_neo_graph_rl

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated tests (`tests/unit/`)
- **Integration Tests**: Tests that verify component interaction (`tests/integration/`)
- **End-to-End Tests**: Full system tests (`tests/e2e/`)

### Writing Tests

- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and failure cases

## Documentation

### Building Documentation

```bash
cd docs/
make html  # Generate HTML documentation
make livehtml  # Auto-reload during development
```

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Document all public APIs
- Update relevant documentation when making changes

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before submitting:**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add entry to CHANGELOG.md
   - Rebase your branch on latest main

2. **Pull Request Guidelines:**
